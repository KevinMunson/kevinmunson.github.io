***COVID and Policy implementations***

Our team examined the COVID data that is put out by the WHO and Cornell as well
the polciy information for each country to see two things:

### 1. What is driving COVID cases?

My team used a random forest on the data and were able to find the policies which explained the most variance in the data and we found that three policies were the most important: closing public transportation, testing policy, and stopping internationl travel.

### 2. Are policies from the government making a difference?

This is the top three countries in terms of cases which are Brazil, the US, and
India. China and France are in there as well for scale.

The top line is weekly cases and the blue is the number of deaths. Each of those are sums for the months. The other lines are the level of the policy and the color on these lines shows the weekyly variance in cases.
