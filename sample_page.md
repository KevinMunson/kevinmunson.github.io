**Federal Government database in SQL:**

Our team was interested in government transparency and helping people understand more about their government. 
In order to do this, we created a database to track some of the physical assets of the government. 

For example, we wanted to know how many vehicles the government has and what type they are:

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

<img src="images/dummy_thumbnail.jpg?raw=true"/>

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
